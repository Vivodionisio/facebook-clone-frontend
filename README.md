# Welcome to my Facebook UI clone

## Project Purpose

This was my first React project. Its purpose was to demonstrate my knowledge of the reactive way of building a UI and structuring a larger project.

## Responsivity

Site is fully responsive.

## Data

There is no backend to this project. The dummy data used for populating posts exists in PostData.js - src/assets/data/PostData.js

### Interactivity

#### Main Navigation (topbar)

The project includes a Home page and Profile page (Jacamo), whilst other pages are unpopulated, existing only to demonstrate main navigation functionality.

#### Sidebars

The sidebars, left and right comprise dummy buttons, aside from the Jacamo link which will take you to the profile.

#### Create post

Clicking on the whats on your mind input feed will open up a modal, created using react portal.

#### Post like button

Clicking a like button will toggle the engagements count. Whilst hovering over the button (after a short delay) will trigger transitions to reveal a row of animated emojis.

#### Post comment button

The project includes a Home page and Profile page (Jacamo), whilst other pages are unpopulated, existing only to demonstrate main navigation functionality.

#### Sidebars

The sidebars, left and right comprise dummy buttons, aside from the Jacamo link which will take you to the profile.

#### Create post

Clicking on the 'whats on your mind' input field will open up a modal, created using react portal.

#### Post like button

Clicking a like button will toggle the engagements count. Whilst hovering over the button (after a short delay) will trigger transitions to reveal a row of animated emojis.

#### Post comment button

Clicking the comment button will reveal the 'write a comment' field. And a comments button which will show comments (these have been hard coded)

## Personal Thoughts

This was a great first React project. I was surprised at how well it came together. However it is far from perfect, for a veriety of reasons. One example is the css which became a little messy â€“ a great learning curve for my next projects. I did refactor it using Sass, so it is improved, though I recognise my apporach to naming classes has yet to be refined at this point.
